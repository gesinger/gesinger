### Hi, I'm Garrett

I work at [Brightcove](https://www.brightcove.com/en/), where I help develop [Video.js](https://github.com/videojs/video.js)' main playback engine, [videojs/http-streaming](https://github.com/videojs/http-streaming) (:vhs: VHS for short).

Have any video playback questions? Check out [debugvideo.com](https://www.debugvideo.com/). If the answer isn't there, let me know! I'm usually around the [Video.js Slack](http://slack.videojs.com).
